</p>


Display a bot on Discord that will listen to the user's input and repeat a sentence for a specific number of times and in the targeted channel. Can also play audio files and links in a voice channel.

- Python, Heroku, SQL.

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/Scylidose/AISNA">AISNA</a></h3>

  AISNA is a project inspired from the Person of Interest TV series and more specifically from this episode excerpt (S4xE05):  

  [![Admin is not Admin](http://img.youtube.com/vi/nhWe2nf24ag/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWe2nf24ag "Person of Interest - Admin is not Admin")


AISNA is a deep learning algorithm which use **live faces recognition** to determine if the person on camera is either an admin or an unknown person. It also uses **voice recognition** to show more features on the broadcast if certain words are used.

- Python.

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/Scylidose/CancerDetection">Cancer Detection (WIP)</a></h3>

Will help to determine if clinical data on unhealthy patients are related to cancer.


<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/Scylidose/VoiceCoding">VoiceCoding (WIP)</a></h3>

Will permit an user to code little instructions in Python using his voice. The instructions can afterward be executed and the result (or error) will be transcribed by a text-to-speech algorithm. 

The goal of this project is to allow the user to code remotely from his computer for a short or longer period of time.

- Python.

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/Scylidose/Botlan">Botlan (WIP)</a></h3>

Botlan is an algorithm that will ingest television series transcripts and output a totally new script.

- Python.
